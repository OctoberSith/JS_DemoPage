            <h3>The 1980's</h3>
            <p>
              As a young boy, I once watchd a SHOWTIME free preview weekend,
              with Phantasm II showing late that saturday night. Equal parts
              terrorizing and engrossing, the movie sticks into my psyche as one
              of the scariest films I have ever seen, mostly due to the
              religious undertones and graphic imagery.

            <h3>The 1990's</h3>
            <p>
              Now a teenager, I am a full blown horror buff and gorehound. I
              spend hours watching all the classic horror films, and even catch
              up on 70s horror such as Daria Argento and the Great Lucio Fulci.
              However, my mind always returns to the Phantasm series and by 1999
              I have watched Phantasm 1-4 several times, having developed a
              particular fondness toward the devious machinations of the Tall
              Man, as well as Mike and Reggie's plight.

            <h3>The 2000's</h3>
            <p>
              While the mainstream slowly drifts away from remembering Phantasm,
              a small collective of individuals pass around information on the
              web about a possible new film that may end the franchise and
              reveal more of the nature of the Tall Man. Rumors of the
              Phantasm's End script circulate, and Don Coscerelli, the series
              creator, has success with some of his other properties, like Bubba
              Ho-Tep, leading to a belief from the Phans we may see a Phantasm
              resurgence.

            <h3>2010+</h3>
            <p>
              The Great Angus Scrimm passes in 2015. Phantasm Ravager is
              released in 2016. It is a footnote to the series and uses elements
              of the Phantasm's End script. It will likely be the conclusion of
              the Phantasm series but does not answer many of the questions
              Phans were hoping to see fulfilled. Rumors begin of possible
              rights being sold to studios, but nothing is concrete. In March
              2022, Coscarelli states he wants to make a Phantasm Video Game,
              which may be the perfect format for a series that would likely
              require a budget no studio would want to finance. Fans await more
              news....
